## List component

We need to build a prototype for a list component in our custom library of UI components. The list component must implement the next features to demo:

- Show the elements of an array
- The elements are part of the domain so each element must implement his own way of showing itself (the item must be a component or a template)

Optional features:

- Order the elements alphabetically. If elements are string or number order by the element, if is an object the list component will need a property of the key or several keys of the object (element) to order by those keys (in the order of the given keys)
- An input element that you can filter the elements of the list by string. We will filter by the showing elements of the element component.

## Example data

You could use the airlines.json and airports.json files in the project to get some demo data.

## Visualization

Here is how the list should look with the airlines and airports data:
